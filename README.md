# Crystal Clear Comments ðŸ”®

A VSCode extension designed to help developers gain insights into the quality & quantity of comments in their code. This extension analyzes comments in C, C++, Python, JavaScript and Java files, providing metrics & visualizations to enhance code documentation practices.

## Features

- **Comment Coverage Analysis**: Calculates the percentage of lines that are comments out of the total non-blank lines.
- **Language Detection**: Automatically detects the programming language (C, C++, Python, JavaScript, Java) and tailors the analysis accordingly.
- **Detailed Comment Breakdown**: Provides a breakdown of single-line and multi-line comments.
- **Comment Length Analysis**: Analyzes the length of comments and visualizes it over the range of lines in the file as a line chart.
- **Word Cloud Generation**: Generates a word cloud of the most frequently used words in the comments, with the size of the word indicating its frequency.
- **Interactive Report Generation**: Generates an HTML report with charts and tables summarizing the comment analysis.

## How to Use the Extension (for Users)

1. Open a Python, C, or C++ file in VSCode.
2. Run the command `Analyze Comments` from the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).
3. The extension will analyze the comments in the current file and generate a report.

## Installation (for Dev/Contributors)

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in VSCode.
3. Press `F5` to start debugging the extension.
4. The extension will launch in a new VSCode window where you can test its functionality.

## Example Report

The extension generates an HTML report with the following sections:

- **Comment Coverage Analysis**: Displays the percentage of comment lines, total comments, and total lines in the file.
- **Charts**:
  - _Comment Types Distribution_: A pie chart showing the distribution of single-line and multi-line comments.
  - _Comment Length_: A line chart showing the length of comments across the file's lines.
- **Word Cloud**: A visual representation of the most frequent words found in comments.
- **Comment Details**: A table listing each comment, its type (single-line or multi-line), and its location in the code.
