## Features

- **Comment Coverage Analysis**: Calculates the percentage of lines that are comments out of the total non-blank lines.
- **Language Detection**: Automatically detects the programming language (C, C++, Python, JavaScript, Java) and tailors the analysis accordingly.
- **Detailed Comment Breakdown**: Provides a breakdown of single-line and multi-line comments, and their distribution visualized in a pie chart.
- **Comment Length Analysis**: Analyzes the length of comments and visualizes it over the range of lines in the file as a line chart.
- **Word Cloud Generation**: Generates a word cloud of the most frequently used words in the comments, with the size of the word indicating its frequency.
- **Interactive Report Generation**: Generates an HTML report with charts and tables summarizing the comment analysis.

## Example Report

The extension generates an HTML report with the following sections:

- **Comment Coverage Analysis**: Displays the percentage of comment lines, total comments, and total lines in the file.
- **Charts**:
  - _Comment Types Distribution_: A pie chart showing the distribution of single-line and multi-line comments.
  - _Comment Length_: A line chart showing the length of comments across the file's lines.
- **Word Cloud**: A visual representation of the most frequent words found in comments.
- **Comment Details**: A table listing each comment, its type (single-line or multi-line), and its location in the code.
- **Input File Code Snippet**: A code snippet of the input file with a copy-to-clipboard button.
